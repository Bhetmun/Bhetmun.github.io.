		<h1>Should we incorporate video games into our education system?</h1>
		<h2>MAD(A) Project Homepage</h2>

		<p>Some key points of my topic that I would cover are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The benefits of video games on education</li>
            <li>Potential downsides of implementing video games into education</li>
            <li>What is the current state of video games in our education system?</li>
            <li>How can we incorporate video games into our education system more?</li>
        </ul>

	<h3>Links to portfolio pages</h3>

	<div id="menu">
		<p>Links to Lab works and IL Tasks</p>
		<a href="lab_week_1.html">Week 1 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="lab_week_2.html">Week 2 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="lab_week_3.html">Week 3 tasks</a><br>
		
		<a href="lab_week_5.html">Week 5 tasks</a><br>

		<a href="lab_week_9.html">Week 9 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="lab_week_10.html">Week 10 tasks</a>
<p>Note the use of an under construction page. This lets you set up the infrastructure of your website but without having links that do not work undermining your design!</p>

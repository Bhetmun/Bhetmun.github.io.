<h2>Task 1</h2>
		
        <p> 
        I decided to use the template provided because I am still quite new to programming and so I thought it would be easier to use this template to assist me with learning how to code. However, even with this template I still find it tricky to understand the details of coding. 
            </p>

		<section id="task2">
<h2>Task 2</h2>
		
            <p>The benefits of using the template are: 
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I can visually see how the tags work </li>
            <li>I can get ideas from the template on how I can structure my work </li>
            <li>It gives me a jump start on my work </li>
        </ul>
		</section>
		
        <section id="task 3">
<h2> Task 3</h2>
        <p>
        This section was not too difficult, the template really helps with identifying how I should layout my work and this is extremely useful.

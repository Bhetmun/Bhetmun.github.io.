    <h3>Reflection </h3>
    <p>I believe that the narrative 'jars of thought' that I came up with helps me visualise the 3 key aspects of this website being the visual aspects, objectives of the website and the audience gains. In the future it will hopefully remind me of what I should remain focused on when considering design choices for my project.  </p>

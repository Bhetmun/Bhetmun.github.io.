    <h1>IL Task</h1>
    <h2>Task 2 - Reevaluating <a href="https://pudding.cool/2023/10/genre/">The Pudding - visual essay website</a></h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Accuracy: Is the text accurate? The text is very accurate and most of the information is backed up by valid supporting evidenc</li>
        <li>Active voice: The website has an active voice, the writer is almost always having a sort of conversation with us as they guide us through the website </li>
        <li>Limit biases: Actually addresses biases and points out how bad the music industry has been with their biases and stereotypes. </li>
        <li>Clarity: The vocabulary that they use is very easy to understand but not too simple. It makes the website sound very casual but sets a mild professional tone. </li>
        <li>Conciseness: Definitely not wordy, they constantly pair their statements with visuals and some parts of the website is just graphics and videos with short headings. </li>
        <li>Conversational and smooth flowing prose: Uses contractions appropriately. Keeps sentences short and concise. </li>
        <li>Correctness: Does not seem to be any grammatical errors or factual errors.</li>
        <li>Parallelism: Lots of parallelism through the descriptions of different music genres. </li>
        <li> Positive voice: Does not seem to have a positive or a negative voice, when reporting on incidents regarding spotify and their biases, the writing keeps a neutral tone.</li>
        <li>Strong Nouns and Verbs: likely did not pay attention to the nouns used </li>
        <li>Sentence variety: Very good at having sentence variety, no sentence actually starts with the same word </li>
        <li>Simple words: Considering the audience, definitely uses simple words, but sometimes uses longer words probably to maintain a slight academic level vocabulary. </li>
        <li>Shorter paragraphs: uses very short paragraphs and sometimes only headings accompanied with graphics.</li>
        <li>Tone and voice: When reviewing the statistics of spotify the tone is quite formal but when talking about the backlash received from media and artist's opinions on spotify's genre categories.</li>
        </ul>    
        
        
    <h2> Task 3</h2>    
        <p>I believe that I have outlined my audience and defined my purpose quite well up to this point however I definitely could work on conducting more broad research as well as working on organising, outlining and categorising all of my work.  </p>

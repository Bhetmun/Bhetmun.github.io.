        <h2>Task 1</h2>
        <h3>How have I engaged with the creative process?</h3>
        <p>I believe that I have somewhat engaged with the creative process. I do not think I did the 5 stages of the creative process until I read this section on the lab but I think that I do engage with parts of it especialy incubation and ideation. However, I definitely think that if I engaged more with preparation then my workflow would be better, I usually do things on the fly without much preparation but sometimes it really is good to prepare.  </p>

        <h3>Evaluation of websites</h3>
        <table border="1"> 
        <tr>

            What are the images used for?

            <td>
                In the second website the images are used to provide support for the headings of the boxes of text. They help summarise the main point and also attract the eyes to them which would help keep readers on the website. 
            </td>
            </tr>
        <tr> 
            <th>What kind of images are used?</th>
            <td>it seems like the websites use vector images since they do not change in quality after zooming in/out, this likely would enhance the potential of access on the website since the images would look just as good on different devices such as mobile phones and laptops.</td>

<h2>Lab Task</h2>
        <h3>Comparing and exploring methods of optimisation</h3>
        <p>Upon reflection I've found that I somewhat struggle with optimising images. I think it is quite a tricky task to figure out which settings are the best for an image. From my experiments, I cannot really tell the difference between an image in rgb and an image that has been indexed. However, I find that there is definitely a 'sweet spot' with the sizing of the images. Too small and it will be detailed but hard to actually observe the details but too large and the image will look distorted and pixelated. Below are the images imported in: </p>

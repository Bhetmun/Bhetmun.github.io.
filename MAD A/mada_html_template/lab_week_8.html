    <ul>
        <li>What is the audio used for - The audio is used to allow users to interact with the videos on screen and prompts on screen to listen to music of the artists being showcased.  </li>
        <li>What advantages and caveats of audio can you witness - all of the audio is set to one single volume that cannot really be adjusted so everything is very loud and may be unpleasing to listen to. However, adding sound does make the website a lot more interactive.  </li>
        <li> The audio is used by linking the sound files to screen buttons on screen that can do several things such as muting videos or playing songs.</li>

    <h3>Exploring Optimised Audio Files</h3>
    <p>After experimenting with the different settings I found that the most significant change to the audio came with changing the output from stereo to mono. This changed the elements in the track that would be played in one ear to being played equally in both ears, it meant a more even listening experience but also to me it meant removing the essence of how the songs were intentioanlly meant to be played. Furthermore changing the hz that the songs were exported in did not lead to a significant increase or decrease in quality, maybe it is because my ears could not pick up the nuances between the different export qualities but that is my experience. I think in my website it would not matter which quality of audio that I would download the songs in but I would definitely maintain the stereo option when exporting files. </p>

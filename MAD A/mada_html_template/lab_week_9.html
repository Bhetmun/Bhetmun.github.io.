    <p>I reviewed the website <a href="https://www.loharris.com">loharris.com</a> and I found that the website mainly uses video to deliver all of their information instead of text. This lead to a more streamlined experience since you can just take a backseat and enjoy then content that they created. I think this is a creative way to show off information but it may not be the most efficient since if you want to scroll through to see the general ideas in a website you cannot do that since all the information is engrained into the video. Moreover, if a user misses a piece of information they cannot just scroll up to find it but instead has to manually go back in the video to try to find the piece they are looking for. I think this format is more suited to a casual website that isn't trying to transfer a lot of information academically.  </p>

    <h3>reflection</h3>
    <p>Upon reflection I find that increasing and decreasing video quality does significantly impact the user experience. However, this is only the case when videos are large enough to be viewed on a bigger screen. By maintaining the video size to 320x240, it actually does not affect the quality of the video much unless it is less than 240p. Adding things such as title cards may not matter too much to increasing the experience of the website since most of the information will be displayed through text anyways and the videos are just support materials. </p>

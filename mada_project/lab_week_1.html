<h2>Task 1</h2>
		<p>*Insert paragraph introducing and reflecting upon task. Don't forget to include any other links/multi-media elements would be appropriate to the task and your chosen design. Remember that you can use the <a href="review_of_useful_tags.html" target="_blank">review_of_useful_tags document</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3schools</a> or our own research to help you find the tags you're looking for!*
            </p>

        I decided to use the template provided because I am still quite new to programming and so I thought it would be easier to use this template to assist me with learning how to code. However, even with this template I still find it tricky to understand the details of coding.

		<section id="task2">
<h2>Task 2</h2>
		<p>*Insert paragraph introducing and reflecting upon task. Don't forget to include any other links/multi-media elements would be appropriate to the task and your chosen design. Remember that you can also use lists like this:*</p>
		<ul>
				<li>point 1</li>
				<li>point 2</li>
				<li>point 3</li>
		</ul>
            <p> 
            The benefits of using the template are: 
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I can visually see how the tags work </li>
            <li>I can get ideas from the template on how I can structure my work </li>
            <li>It gives me a jump start on my work </li>
        </ul>
		</section>
		
        <section id="task 3">
<h2> Task 3</h2>
        <p>
        This section was not too difficult, the template really helps with identifying how I should layout my work and this is extremely useful.

<h3>Task 1</h3>
    <p>Table of Audience Characteristics:</p>
        <table border="1">
            <th>Audience Characteristic</th>

            <tr> 
            <td>Age</td>    
            <td>Adults - the topic involves incorporating video games into a young audience of learners however it would be the adults that incorporate this into their learning space. They would have to keep in mind the technological capabilities of the students and how complicated the games are.</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
            <td>Gender </td>
            <td>Mixed - The audience would be mixed since it involves education which contains both genders. I do not believe gender would impact greatly on how this topic would proceed in terms of presentation.</td>  
            
            <tr> 
            <td>Language Proficiency</td>    
            <td>This is difficult as a video games accessibility depends on how dependant it is on language. If it is a game that requires a lot of instructions to operate, there may be issues regarding how well we can communicate that in languages other than english, but at an early stage of learning, the video games should not be language orientated but instead focused on mechanical processes such as matching shapes and problem solving at a low level.</td>
            </tr>
            
            <tr>
            <td>Education Level</td>
            <td>I believe this topic should be introduced at a stage early enough where the children are competent enough and at an appropriate age to be exposed to technology at increased levels. As such introducing this at ages such as the final stages of primary education may be more suitable. That being said, as for the audience reading this, they should have a base level understanding of how the education system functions as it currently stands and what flaws it may have and how we can improve upon it. </td>
                
            <tr> 
            <td>Attitude Towards writer or organisation</td>    
            <td>Ideally the audience should be open to the idea of change in the education system, not because of flaws but rather as a point of furthering and improving what we currently have to match the age of technology that we are currently in.</td>

            <tr>
            <td>Knowledge of topic</td>

            <tr> 
            <td>Audience Action</td>

    <p><a href="https://pudding.cool/2023/10/genre/">The Pudding - visual essay website</a></p>
        <table border="1">
            <tr> 
                <th>Audience</th>
                <td> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The specific one that I looked at covered the topic of spotify music charts. It is clear the audience are music analysts who are specifically interested in the topic given that it is very minimalistic and straight to the point, but the audience age group is still somewhat young which we can tell from their use of emojis throughout the website </li>
                        <li>The range and depth of the material is appropriate, the ones interested in this are probably not too professional but still have an understanding of the meaning of statistics. The visuals that they do provide such as graphs and clickable music icons are very well suited for the audience as they are also users that are looking to expand their music library </li>
                        <li> There is plenty of interactivity with the website, you navigate the pages by clicking or pressing arrow keys and on several slides you can click on boxes to play the music of the artists that they are referencing</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul> 
                        <li>The purpose of the website is to provide and idea on how the most popular genres of music has changed over the years on spotify, but the secondary purpose is to encourage users to explore new music and not just what is trending. </li>
                        <li> The project is very easy to navigate given that you only need to click and the website will simply show you the next page, it is also has an intuitive 'going back' system where you can click the bar at the top of the page to go back to a previous page</li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Makes good use of color since it uses neutral colours which does not stand out and is still pleasant to the eyes for a background </li>
                        <li> uses bright green for the interactive elements of the website, a nice touch since they are writing about spotify which has a green logo</li>
                        <li>The graphics and information is constantly changing layout but it is always laid out in a clear way that is easy to read and simple to follow</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Relevant to target audience, pays more attention to mention artists who are trending more which leans more towards the target audience as those artists relate more to a general audience </li>
                        <li>The content mentions several sources throughout the website including from the artists that they reference themselves, this makes the website quite credible. </li>

                        <li>No use of images, just a big chunk of text. Would not be so bad but it is all in one big paragraph and there is no attempt to organise and make some kind of layout.</li>

                        <li>Font is professional looking and sized well but there is no spacing between each line and it is one big paragraph, this makes it quite difficult to read. </li>

<h2>Task 3 </h2>
    <h3>Mood board</h3>
    <img src="images/mood_board.jpg" alt="moodboard" width="620" height="611">
    
    <p>
    I believe that the colour choice for this website should be neutral colours such as beige with incorporations of grey or black because it gives the website quite a professional look. One of the things I disliked about the website I looked at (mashable) was that it was one large paragraph and did not try to use any other visuals to present their ideas and story, therefore the website should incorporate plenty of visuals to accompany any statistic I would be using presenting.
